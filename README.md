WeatherApp GUI in Python

A simple, interactive weather-application with graphical user interface built using Python.

Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a desktop weather application with a GUI, using Python. It fetches live weather data from a web API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Ideal for practising GUI development, API integration, and Python event-driven programming.

Graphical user interface (GUI) built using a Python GUI framework (e.g., Tkinter / PyQt).

Error-handling when city is not found or network/API issues occur.

Clean, readable UI design suitable for beginners and intermediate developers.

Modular code structure to separate UI, API logic and data handling.
